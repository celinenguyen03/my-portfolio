        <p>Gamers tend to not pursue a career in gaming due to its <b>instability and difficulty of entry.</b> For my own personal project, <b>I designed solutions focused on addressing these pain points</b> identified during the discovery phase. After using the <b>career-building app, 80% of participants</b> who initially didn’t consider gaming as a career reported a <b>change in mindset</b>, expressing increased interest in pursuing gaming as a <b>viable career path.</b></p>

        <p class="pspace">I wanted to see if I was missing any possible alternatives to a career in gaming, so I conducted user interviews with 5 skilled gamers who are currently pursuing a different career. I asked these questions to find out all the options that are out there and how they felt about the industry as a whole, which I then organized into affinity mapping.</p>

            <li>If gaming was more sustainable, would you consider it as a viable career option?</li>

        <p>After conducting the interviews, I realized that there were a lot of things that were many ways to tackle this problem. I spent 2 weeks exploring various features that I could’ve addressed in my app. There were many things to consider, different user types, compatibility with other products, and personalized coaching. However, I couldn’t tackle everything at once and had to narrow down the options for the initial launch, with additional features being put on low-priority for future implementation.</p>

        <h2>Reflections</h2>
        <h1>Final Reflections and future plans</h1>
        <p class="pspace">This was my favorite UX project! I’m so happy to have developed this project as it taught me a lot about the design process. Here are some of the key points I’ve learned from this project</p>
        <ol class="case-list">
            <li><strong>Prioritize the happy path first.</strong> Initially, there were many users I had in mind for who would use this product. Thinking about how I could cater each individuals experiences to the app was overwhelming and it was easier to develop the product with the main user in mind first, and then the other use cases should come a lot easier.</li>
            <li><strong>Don’t limit yourself to a few solutions.</strong> There were SO many ideas I had, ranging from developing a coaching feature and incorporating a tournament feature onto the platforms. I definitely didn’t expect Aimer to look how it does now, but I pushed myself to narrow down the most important aspects that were needed that I felt best solved this problem.</li>
            <li><strong>Tradeoffs are important for every decision.</strong> I really wanted this app to have a personalized touch to make it feel like every user has someone who can help them and truly understand their situation. But given the scope of the potential users being in the millions, I’ve employed AI as that figure who users can look towards for guidance. Leveraging current advancements in technology are important and making sure that I communicate the tradeoffs at every step is crucial to be a good designer.</li>
