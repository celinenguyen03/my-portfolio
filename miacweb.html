            <h1>Attitudinal UX Research</h1>
            <h2 class="first">@ Multi-Identity Art Collective</h2>
            <p>This is an attitudinal research project I led at Multi-Identity Art Collective (MIAC). The high level objective of the study was to uncover user needs and understand how users feel, thus to inform the design decisions for their website.</p>
            <p>This project exemplifies my user-centered approach, where I conducted extensive user research to ensure the design aligned with real user needs and pain points.</p>

            <h2>Background and Goals</h2>
            <p>The organization needed evidence from research to determine what features their website needed to appeal to users and gain more traction. Some key goals we have:</p>
            <p><b>User Needs Research Goals</b></p>
            <ol class="case-list">
                <li>Understand the key features and content users expect from the website redesign.</li>
                <li>Identify user pain points in the current site to inform the design process.</li>
                <li>Explore how the website can better serve user needs to increase satisfaction and engagement.</li>
            </ol>
            <p><b>Engagement Research Goals</b></p>
            <ol class="case-list">
                <li>Identify features that encourage users to return to the site more frequently.</li>
                <li>Explore users motivations for joining organizations and attending events, so we can increase engagement.</li>
                <li>Determine which content or services users are most likely to engage with and share.</li>

        <div>
            <h2>Methods</h2>
            <p>To achieve these goals, I decided to adopt a variety of UXR activities to collect both attitudinal and qualitative data. We first conducted 10 <b>client surveys</b>, which allowed us to gain insight on their objectives. Additionally, I held <b>user interviews</b> with 9 individuals who pursue art and developed user <b>personas</b> based on the interviewees to find trends that motivate people to join art communities. After gathering insights from the target audience, I ran a <b>competitive analysis</b> on 2 of the largest organizations on campus, pinpointing key features for success and opportunities.</p>

            <h2>Crucial Insights</h2>
            <p><b>Based on the trends from the competitive analysis and insights from various students on campus, I’ve noticed how people find it difficult to join already established communities, especially if they do not know much about the organization. Trying to mitigate this fear that students have by providing them with the resources necessary to help guide their joining decision is an important aspect to consider when developing the website.</b></p>
            <p>Students on campus feel an “invisible barrier” that bars new members from joining clubs, especially if the club highlights a skill that is known to have a competitive environment like art. By relieving students of their fear of a high skill requirement and creating an inviting environment through effective branding and marketing.</p>
            <p>Another factor to consider is how much information is out there initially, that “hook” factor that motivates people to join the club from first sight. Many students do not go out of their way to do additional research on organizations. If all the relevant information isn’t there, such as the events, who they are, and how to get involved on first glance, students do not feel inclined to take initiative.</p>
            <p>With the original design of the website, content was scattered across the navigation, adding cognitive friction to the equation when people are looking for key information. It’s hard for users to attend events in-person if they couldn’t find information on the event online.</p>
